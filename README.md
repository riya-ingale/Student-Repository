# Student-Repository

### Introduction
This Web-Application makes Student’s data easily available so the physical workload is less and professors can handle it in a more efficient way. 
<br>It also provides an easy way for a professor to verify the student's marksheet or any other certificate. 

### Features 
 - Student can Add, Update, Delete its Information in an organized manner<br>
 - Students are allotted to either of the three mentors and then mentors can view, edit or delete student’s details. These Mentors can search for the students who are registered to them and can easily view and Authenticate their Documents.
 - Student can view and download a dynamically generated pdf which has their entered details and information.
 
 In brief, we have proposed a system for smooth transfer of Documents and Certificates, their Authentication status, and Updation of Details between the student and the Mentor.
